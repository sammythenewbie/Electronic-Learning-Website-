                            Defragmentation <br>
                            -	is a process that reduces the amount of fragmentation. <br>
                            -	Physically organizing the contents of the mass storage device used to store files into the smallest number of contiguous regions (fragments).<br>
                            -	Attempts to create larger regions of free space using compaction to impede the return of fragmentation. Some defragmentation utilities try to keep smaller files within a single directory together, as they are often accessed in sequence.<br>
                            Defragmentation is advantageous and relevant to file system on electromechanical disk drives. The movement of the hard drives read/write heads over different areas of the disk when accessing fragmented files is slower, compared to accessing the entire contents of a non-fragmented file sequentially without moving the read/write heads to seek other fragments. <br>
                            <br>
                            IN WINDOWS 7, FOLLOW THESE STEPS TO PULL A MANUAL DEFRAG OF THE PC’S MAIN HARD DRIVE:<br>
                            •	Open the computer window.<br>
                            •	Right-click the media you want to defragment, such as the main hard drive, C.<br><br>
                            DEFRAGMENTING <br>
                        •	Is commonly called defragging. <br>
                        •	No matter what you call it, defragging or defragmenting your hard drive will speed up disk performance. If you haven’t defragmented your PC’s hard drive in while (or ever), you’re in for a treat.
                       <br> •	
                            A freshly defragmented hard drive makes your computer seem brand new.
                            <br>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                IN THE DRIVE’S PROPERTIES DIALOG BOX, CLICK THE TOOLS TAB. <br>
                                <img src="disk defrag.jpg" alt="" class="embedded">
                            •	Click the Defragment Now button. <br>
                            •	The disk Defragmenter window appears. Rather
                            than plow ahead and potentially waste time 
                            defragmenting a drive that doesn’t need it, check
                            the media’s current fragmentation. <br>
                            •	Click the Analyze Disk button. <br>
                            •	Wait while windows checks the defragmentation
                            on the media. <br>
                            •	Check the percent fragmented value by the disk 
                            defragmenter window. If it’s zero, there’s no point
                            in continuing: skip to step 8. <br>
                            •	Even when the drive shows 0 percent fragmented
                            files, you can still proceed with defragmentation. 
                            No  media can be fully defragmented, so the
                            windows defragmenter will always find something 
                            to do. <br>
                            •	Click the  Defragment Disk button. <br>
                            •	Windows defragments the media. Sit back and
                            watch, or do something else, through you shouldn’t
                            do anything on you computer while the media is 
                            being defragmented. <br>
                            •	Click the close button, and close up any other windows you opened. <br>
                            •	You may not notice any drastic improvement in disk performance, specially when the hard drive is frequently defragmented. But if you .just defragmented your PC’s hard dive for the first time, prepared to be stunned. <br>
                            •	You cannot defragment a network drive. <br>
                            •	Do not defragment a media card or flash drive. These drives a limited number of “writes” available to them. That is, the media can support data being written to it a finite number of times. This number can be huge, but it’s a real number; after reaching the number, the media  becomes useless. By not defragmenting a media card or flash drive, you avoid accelerating the deadlines. <br>
                            •	Optical drives cannot be defragmented. <br>
                            •	Even after running the  defragmentation utility, file fragment remain on the hard drives. That’s just the nature of disk storage. Please don’t obsess and run the defragmentation utilities over nd over, trying to get a perfectly defragmented hard drive. <br>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                HARD DRIVE GETS FRAGMENTED <br>
                            It takes the computer much more to find files are scattered here, there and everywhere. <br>
                            •	Fragmentation makes you hard disk do extra work that can slow down your computer. Removable storage devices such as USB flash drives can also become fragmented. Disk defragmenter in windows re-arrange fragmented data so your disks and drives can work more efficiently. Disk defragmenter runs on a schedule, but you can also analyze and defragment your disks and drives manually. To do this, follow these steps:
                            <br><br>

                            TO DEFRAGMENT YOUR HARD DISK: <br>
                            1.	Open disk defragmenter by clicking the start button. In the search bar, type Disk Defragmenter, and then, in the list of result, click Disk Defragmenter.
                            <br> 2.	Under current status, select the disk you want to defragment.
                            <br> 3.	To determined if the disk needs to be defragmented or not, click Analyze disk.
                            <br>  If your prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password o provide confirmation.
                            Once windows is finish analyzing the disk you can check the percentage of fragmentation on the disk in the Last Run column. If the number is  above 10% you should defragment the disk.
                            <br>  4.	Click Defragment disk 
                            <br> If you’re prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.
                            Disk defragmenter might take from several minutes to a few hours to finish, depending on the size and agree of fragmentation of your hard disk.
                            You can still use your computer during the defragmentation process
                            <br> NOTES <br>
                            If the disk is already in exclusive use by another program or is formatted using a file system other than NTFS file system, FAT, or FAT32, it can’t be defragmented.

•	Disk partitioning is to divide the hard drive into multiple logical units. People don’t often choose to partition their hard disks, but it has many benefits. Mainly, by partitioning your disk, you can separate your operating system from your data and thus reduce the chances of your data becoming corrupted.
<br><br>
1.	Open the Computer Management tool. <br>
•	Open the Start menu. <br>
•	Type “Computer Management” in the search bar of the start menu and press enter. <br>

<br><br>
2.	Select the Disk Management tool.<br>
•	Click on Disk Management on the left of the window and you should see all of the disk and their partitions on your computer. <br>
•	In the example in the picture, there is 1 disk with two partition. <br>

<br><br>
3.	Make some space for the new partition. <br>
•	Right-click on the partition you wish to re-size and select the Shrink Volume option. In the example in the picture the (C:) drive is used.
<br>
•	Note: There may be a partition named System Reserved. It is not recommended that you alter this partition at all.
<br><br>

    

      4.Shrink the drive <br>
•	Enter the size you wish shrink your drive to in megabytes (1000 MB). Then click on the shrink button. In this example the drive is shrink by 10000 MB or 10 GB.
<br>
•	Note: You cannot shrink the volume greater than the amount indicated in the Size of available shrink space in MB section.

<br><br>

5.	Create a new volume.<br>
•	You should now see a new unallocated partition in your Disk Management window. Right-click on the unallocated partition and select the New Simple Volume option.
<br><br>
6.	The New Simple Volume Wizard. <br>
•	The New Simple Volume Wizard should pop up click on the Next button to continue. 

<br><br>

7.	Enter size of new partition. <br>
•	Enter the amount of memory you wish to allocate for your new partition and click the Next button. In the example in the picture, the maximum memory available is allocated to the new volume.
<br>
•	Note: You cannot make your new volume larger than the maximum amount of the memory available.
<br><br>

8.	Give the new volume a letter name or path. <br>
•	Select from the menu, a letter name for your new partition and click on the “Next” button. The letter name chosen for the example in the picture is (E:)
<br>
•	The letter name or path is used by windows to identify and navigate to your new volume. 
<br><br>

9.	Setting for the new volume <br>
•	Click on the Format this volume with the following settings:
<br>
•	For File System, select NTFS
<br>
•	For Allocation unit size, select Default
<br>
•	For Volume Label, type the name you wish to give your new drive.
<br>
•	Click on the Perform a quick format
<br>
•	Then click on the Next button
<br><br>


10.	Create the new volume. Look over your settings click on the Finish button
<br><br>
11.	Format the new volume. <br>
•	You will a pop up asking you to partition your new drive. Click on the Format disk button.
<br>
•	A new window will pop up. Keep the settings and click on the Start button.
<br>
•	A warning will pop up. Click on the OK button. 
<br><br>
12.	Check new volume. If everything was done correctly, you should no see your new drive in the Disk Management window.

                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   <b>What is a peer-to-peer network?</b> <br>
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  A peer-to-peer network is an information technology (IT) infrastructure allowing two or more computer systems to connect and share resources without requiring a separate server or server software Workplaces may set up a P2P network by physically connecting computers into a linked system or creating a virtual network. You can also set up computers to be the clients and servers of their network.
                                <br><br>
                                  <b>STEP BY STEP PEER TO PEER:</b> <br>
STEP 1: NAVIGATE TO THE DESKTOP <br>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Open command prompt [1] and then use the command <cd Desktop> to change into the desktop directory. This step is simply for convenience so that it is easier to find the folder you're going to be working with.
 You can open command prompt by clicking on the windows button at the bottom left and tying <cmd>.
<br>
<img src=".\Lesson\Picture3.jpg" alt=""><br>
STEP 2: CREATE YOUR FOLDER <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Use the command <md *folder name*> [2]. Make sure that it is visible on your desktop.
<br>
[2] The command md allows you to create a new folder. After tying md press space and type the name of the folder you want to create. If the folder has more than one word in the name make sure to put the name in quotation marks.
<br>
<img src=".\Lesson\Picture4.jpg" alt=""><br>
STEP 3: NAVIGATE TO THE FOLDER AND OPEN THE PROPERTIES <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;          Open the file explorer and go under the Desktop section. Left-click then right-click on the folder. The left-click highlights the folder, and the right-click opens a menu of options. Once the menu of options pops up click on the properties. When you open the properties window go to the sharing section.
<br>
<img src=".\Lesson\Picture6.jpg" alt=""><br>



STEP 4: CHOOSE WHO YOU WANT TO SHARE WITH. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;         Type <Everyone> and click add [3]. Once you're done with that click share and then go to the advanced sharing.
<br>
<img src=".\Lesson\Picture7.jpg" alt=""><br>
[3] The default setting for the folder is set to only read. This means that if a person accesses the folder they will only be able to view the files and not actually be able to write to the folder.
<br>
STEP 5: SHARING THE FOLDER <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Press the box that lets you share the folder and then go into the permissions section. <br>
<img src=".\Lesson\Picture8.jpg" alt=""><br>


STEP 6: PERMISSIONS <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     Make sure to give full control to the people that have access to the shared folder. Click Apply then click OK. Once you press OK you'll be back at the advanced sharing page. Press Apply and OK on that page too.
 <br>
 <img src=".\Lesson\Picture9.jpg" alt=""><br>

STEP 7: OPEN CONTROL PANEL <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     Navigate into the control panel and click on the Network and Internet section.
<br>
<img src=".\Lesson\Picture10.jpg" alt=""><br>

STEP 8: NETWORK AND SHARING <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     Navigate into the Network and Sharing section.
  <br>
  <img src=".\Lesson\Picture11.jpg" alt=""><br>

STEP 9: ADVANCED SHARING <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Navigate to the advanced sharing.
<br>
<img src=".\Lesson\Picture12.jpg" alt=""><br>

10: CHOOSE HOME AND WORK / PUBLIC <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        There are many settings that need to be changed in both of the options.
<br>
<img src=".\Lesson\Picture13.jpg" alt=""><br>

STEP 11: SELECT ALL OPTIONS <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are going to be many options, the ones you need for the sharing to work are pretty common sense like making sure that your device is allowed to be discovered. And turn off password protected sharing
<br>
<img src=".\Lesson\Picture14.jpg" alt=""><br>


  STEP 12: GO INTO NETWORK <br>
     
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   Go onto another computer and open the file explorer. Go into the Network section found on the left hand side at the bottom.
<br>
<img src=".\Lesson\Picture15.jpg" alt=""><br>

STEP 13: FIND THE DEVICE <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Find the original device that the file was shared from.
<br>
<img src=".\Lesson\Picture16.jpg" alt=""><br>

STEP 14: FIND THE FOLDER THAT WAS SHARED <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once you click on the device you will find all the files that were shared from it. You can tell that the folder is shared over the network because it has the green crossroads looking thing under its name.

<b>PHOTO ADJUSTMENT AND RETOUCHING</b>
<b>SHARPENING AN IMAGE</b>
Sharpening in photoshop is exaggerating the edges of an image by increasing the contrast. There are many tools in Photoshopyou can use to sharpen you image:<br><br>
<b>SHARPEN TOOL</b>
Located in the toolbar is the Sharpen tool. It increases contrast in the areas where you paint and you can choose the brush, mode, and strenght of the sharpening in the options bar. Take note to set the strenght level very low because too much sharpening with this tool can create too much noise on the image.<br><br>
<img src=".\Lesson\Ps1.png" alt=""> 
<br>
<b>SHARPENING FILTERS</b>
Click Filter in the menu bar and point to Sharpen. There are 4 different Sharpening Filters you can choose and each of them has specific sharpening functions that can be effective to sharpening your image.<br><br>
<img src=".\Lesson\Ps2.png" alt=""> 
<br>
<b>1.	Unsharp Mask</b>
The widely used sharening filter that scans the image for areas where pixels whose tonal values differ by a certain quantity (the  “threshold,” chosen by you) are right next to each other.
These areas tend to be edges, and the filters lets you sharpen these edges by increasing the contrast of pixels within those areas. In other words, you lighten the light pixels and darken the darkpixels, and the boundaries between them become more pronounced.<br><br>
<img src=".\Lesson\Ps3.png" alt=""> 
<br>
<b>2.	Smart Sharpen</b>
Lets you control how much sharpening happens in your image’s shadows and highlights. You can choose between Basic and Advance options for sharpening your image and can even  save your settings so you can apply the same settings to multiple images easily. The proccess of sharpening an image with Smart Sharpen is slightly slower than with Unsharp Mask.<br><br>
<img src=".\Lesson\Ps4.png" alt=""> 
<br>
<b>Basic Sharpening</b>
<b>Gaussian Blur</b> - It sharpens identically to the Unsharp Mask filter. <br>
<img src=".\Lesson\Ps5.png" alt=""> 
<br>
<b>Lens Blur </b> - The best choice in the group because it allows you to sharpen typical optical lens blurring. It provides finer sharpening of detal and does a better job of reducing sharpening halos than the Gaussian Blur setting.
<br><img src=".\Lesson\Ps6.png" alt=""> 
<br>
<b>Motion Blur</b> - It works best when you want to remove small amounts of motion blur that resulted from camera movement. Click the wheel to the right of the Angle field to set the direction of the motion that needs to be removed.<br><br>
<br><img src=".\Lesson\Ps7.png" alt=""> 
<br>
<b>USING LEVELS AND CURVES ADJUSTMENT</b>
These are the two most important image editing tools in Photoshop that are very helpful in bumping up your image’s contrast and in applying advance color editing. The two are very similar in terms of creating adjustments for the shadows, highlights, and midtones but thier approach is different which is good when you want specific adjustments to your image.<br><br>
<img src=".\Lesson\Ps8.png" alt=""> 
<br>
<b>LEVELS</b>
Allows you to adjust the highlights (the far right while slider), shadows (the far left black slider), and midtones (the middle grey slider). The graph you see in the window is teh same as the histogram panel which shows you the things you need to improve on your image ( having no lines on the two sides of the graph means the colors are all in the midtones side thus the image is lacking contrast).
These boxes shows you the current black, while and midtone levels. The box on the left, with a default value of 0, shows us the current black point level. The box on the right, with a default value of 255, shows us the current white point level:
<br>
You can also choose preset levels settings here.
<br>
You can choose what channel you want to adjust.
<br>
Drag the sliders to the left and right edges below the histogram to darken the shadows and brighten the highlights. Do this while previewing the result on the image.
<img src=".\Lesson\Ps9.png" alt=""> <br><br>
<b>CURVES</b>
You can adjust your image by dragging the diagonalline to create a point and reshaping it into a curve. Unlike the Levels command with three sliders to adjust the image, the curves line has small squares on either end, one in the bottom left coner directly above pure black in the gradient below it and one in the top right corner directly above pure white in the gradient. These squares, or points, are the Curves equivalent of the black and white sliders  in the Levels dialog box. For the midtones, clicking and dragging on the middle of the line to create a point changes the midtones of the image.
<br>
You can also add points as many as you want and can preview the changes directly on the image so you need to place the curves window where you can preview your image as a whole.

                HTML deals with structure while CSS deals with style. With CSS you will recognize some similarities with HTML attribute names and values.
                But in CSS yu will use curly  braces {   }  colons :  and semi colon ; and you will use selectors and declarations.
                <br>
                If you want to apply the formatting from the separate CSS file to the HTML document, 
                you attach the style sheet to the page using a link tag. You can link all your web pages to a single CSS file.
                Any changes you make to the CSS file are then reflected in all your pages making it easy to update the layout of your pages.
                <br><br>

                <b>Capabilities of CSS</b>
                1.	CSS makes your pages easily updateable. CSS makes it possibe to update the layout of the entire page quickly. You can also specify a style  once and you can apply it as many times in your document.<br>
                2.	Position objects on the page. CSS gives you control when placing objects on the page exactly where you want them.<br>
                3.	Layer objects on the pages. CSS allows you to position objects in three dimensions.<br>
                4.	Create custom tags. CSS allows you to create custom tags to achieve specialized objectives<br><br>

                <b>Advantages of Using CSS</b>
                1.	Save typing and development time because you have to enter CSS code only once and it can be applied to many HTML scripts.<br>  
                2.	Download faster because your browser will download only one file once.<br>
                3.	You can also add multiple link tags in one document.<br><br>

                <b>THREE KINDS OF CSS</b>
                <b>- External Style Sheets</b>
                These are the most global of the three kinds of CSS because you can apply the same one to an unlimited number of pages. 
                They allow you to develop a consistent style across pages. They easily allow you to change the layout of your entire Website by simply changing the external style sheet and every page is instantly updated.
                External CSS file has a .css file extension.<br>
                <code>
                    <span>
                        Ex. &lt;link rel=”CSS”   title=”Default”  href=”style.css” type=”text/css”&gt;
                    </span>
                </code><br><br>

                <b>- Embedded Style Sheets (Internal Style Sheets)</b>
                These are used for creating a document-wide style rule. They are placed within an HTML document, between the &lt;head&gt; and &lt;&#47;head&gt;.<br>
                <code>
                    <span>
                        Ex.  &lt;style type=”text/css”>&lt;&#47;style&gt;
                    </span>
                </code><br>
                They are also used when you have a page that you want to present in a diferent style from other pages. Embedded style sheets override external style sheets.<br><br>

                <b>- Inline Style Sheets</b>
                These are used for isolated changes to  headline, paragraph, picture or other element. Inline style sheets override external and embedded style sheets.<br>
                <code>
                    <span>
                        Ex. &lt;p style=”background-color: gray;”>&lt;/p&gt;
                    </span>
                </code><br><br>

                <b>These are two things that you should remember when using the CSS code.</b>
                1.	The type attribute should always be &lt;style type=”text/css”&gt;<br>
                2.	CSS code should be enclosed in HTML  comments &lt'! -- ... --&gt; so that in a web browser that does not undestand CSS will not see the CSS  code. Today, However, all current browsers support CSS.<br><br>
                
                <b>Inline Styles</b>
                You can define the style for a single element using the style attribute. There are various tags that have the style attribute and that said line would be its value.<br>

                <img src="Lesson/inline.png" alt="" style="width: 500px;height: 300px;"><br>

                As seen in the preceding example style=”font-family : Arial” made the paragraph with it be written in a different typefaceas the first and second paragraph. This type of CSS is called inline styles because it is exactly located where the content is.
                In this line font-family : Arial , font-family is called <i>property</i> and Arial as <i>value</i>. Do you remember how to specify multiple typefaces in &lt;font&gt;&lt;&#47;font&gt; ? You use commas to separate the values of the face attribute. Likewise, the CSS syntax regards commas similarly.
                <code>
                    <span>
                        Ex. style=”font-family : Arial , Helvetica , Verdana”
                    </span>
                </code><br>

                You can add  as many decorations you like as long as you pace semi-colon and familiarize yourself with the syntax for the values that you can pplace there.<br>
                Ex.style=”font-family : Arial , Helvetica ; color : Red; text-align : justify”<br><br>

                <b>Embedded Styles</b>
                Embedded styles or internal styles are defined by the container tag &lt;style&gt; &lt;/style&gt; and placed within the head part of the HTML file. It provides style to the whole HTML file.<br>
                Inline styles are put on the exact tag where the style will be implemented while embedded styles take rather approach since it is a doument-wide style. Here is an example of how an embedded style is used: <br>

                <img src="Lesson/embedded.jpg" alt="" style="width: 570px;height: 270px;"><br>

                In the preceding example, the head part contains an embedded style which writes all paragraphs in the Web page in Arial typefaces and in red.
                Notice too that the attributes are encased within braces. The open brace has a p (representing &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;, hence,called as selectors) before it, 
                signifying that all attributes within from the open brace (closest to it) up to the next closing brace will be affecting all paragraphs
                or contents encased in &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; in the whole HTML file. That’s why all paragraphs in the preceding example were affected. So to speak, embedded styles are document-wide styles. <br>

                The next example, illustrates another CSS embedded style which uses h1 as the selector. The h1 selector will change the attributes of the h1 to the specified color, in which this example indicates blue color for heading h1.
                Since the font is not specified it will retain the default font, in the browser, it is the New Times Roman. <br><br>

                <b>Linked Styles </b>
                External style sheets or linked styles are made outside the HTML file. An external style sheets is linked via &lt;links&gt;. The &lt;links&gt; element allows you to establish document relationships. 
                The &lt;links&gt; elements tells the browser to find the specified style sheet. It can only be used within the &lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt; section of the document. The style sheet file does not contain any HTML code, it contains only style rules.<br><br>

                A CSS file is a style sheet that does not contain anything but the styles so in order for it to take effect, it needs to be linked. Do you remember how embedded style are written ? A CSS  file is simply just like that minus all the HTML tags.<br>
                
                Just like HTML files, it can be written in any text editor then saved with a file extensions of .css. Remember to change the file type to <i>All files</i>.<br>

                With external style sheets you can modify many Web pages by just modifying one CSS file.<br><br>

                <b>Creating an External CSS File</b>
                The following steps will allow you to create and text a basic style sheet. Save your file and test or view your output in the browser.<br>
                1.	Open a new blank document in Notepad.<br>
                2.	Type the style you want to define.<br>
                3.	 On the Menu Bar click File and click Save.<br>
                4.	Type your file name with a extension.css and change the file type to <i>All Files</i>.<br><br>

                <b>Linking CSS File to HTML File</b>
                1.	After creating your CSS file, open your HTML file.<br>
                2.	Type the following inside the HTML file: <br>
                 <code>
                    <span>
                        &lt;link ref=”stylesheet” href=”(name of the file).css” type =”text/css”/&gt; <br>
                        Ex: &lt;link ref=”stylesheet” href=”ewebsite.css” type =”text/css”/&gt;
                    </span>
                 </code><br>
                3.	Save your HTML file.<br>

<br>
<small>* Note:
    The Windows Server 2016 (Desktop Experience) installation includes the Windows 10 GUI and the Server Manager.
    
    The Windows Server 2016 without the Desktop Experience, is what we have known to be the Core installation and doesn't include a GUI interface and the Server manager.
    
    <br>
    Important: Unlike some previous releases of Windows Server, you cannot convert between Server Core and Server with Desktop Experience after installation. For example, if you install Server Core and later decide to user Server with Desktop Experience, you should do a fresh installation (and vice versa).
    
    In this tutorial, we choose to install the Windows Server 2016 Standard with the Desktop Experience. I prefer this option, because many companies have server based applications and needs the full GUI to operate well.
